The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A watched pot never boils.
All that glitters is not gold.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fortune favors the bold.
Haste makes waste.
Ignorance is bliss.
